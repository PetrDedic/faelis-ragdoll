    "title": "About the Ragdoll cat breed",
    "paragraph1": "Ragdoll cats are classified as semi-longhaired cats and it is a relatively young breed, whose origin you will learn more about in the history of the Ragdoll breed. The Ragdoll is one of the kindest and most good-natured breeds you will find among cat breeds. It is said to have a dog-like temperament, and it is true that the Ragdoll enjoys retrieving and also easily learns to go for walks in a harness. It is among the largest cat breeds, but in my opinion, you will hardly see a breeding Ragdoll male weighing 8 kilos or more today, although literature reports up to 10 kg. However, one Ragdoll made it into the Guinness Book of Records in 1986 as the largest domestic cat in the world. His name is Ragtime Bartholomew and you can see him in the picture below (he lived from 18.5.1980 - 18.10.1991).",
    "paragraph2": "Stories that Ragdoll cats don't feel pain like other cats is a nonsensical myth. Ragdolls are just very trusting towards humans and other animals. Grooming a Ragdoll's coat is not demanding, as its silky coat has no tendency to matt. It is enough to brush it once a week, although during the shedding period, daily brushing may be necessary.",
    "paragraph3": "Ragdoll kittens are born completely white and only begin to show color after a few days. A Ragdoll's coloring is not complete until the age of 4 years, when its physical development is also complete.",
    "paragraph4": "According to the standard, a Ragdoll should be a muscular and large cat with strong bones, a full chest, and a short and powerful neck. The legs are medium-length, with the rear legs slightly higher. The large paws have a round shape with tufts of hair growing between the toes. The tail length is proportional to the body. The head is wedge-shaped with a firm, strong chin. Medium-sized ears are set far apart and have rounded tips. The nose is slightly curved, the eyes large, oval, and always blue."

  "history": {
    "title": "History of the Ragdoll breed",
    "paragraph1": "The Ragdoll is a relatively young breed that originated in the early 1960s by Ann Baker, a cat breeder from Riverside, California. The ancestor of the breed is Josephine, a white Persian-type cat that was owned by Ann Baker's neighbor, Mrs. Pennels. It is said that Josephine fell under a car during pregnancy and miraculously survived the accident. According to Mrs. Baker, this traumatic event transformed Josephine into an extremely compliant cat. When lifted from the ground, she went limp like a rag doll and allowed almost anything without resistance.",
    "paragraph2": "All kittens born to her afterward allegedly acquired this new \"temperament\" of hers, and Ann Baker emphasized this when establishing the new breed. Of course, external influences (such as a car accident) cannot affect the temperament traits of Josephine's offspring; these are influenced only by genetics and by selecting individuals for further breeding, with emphasis on the temperament traits of the selected cat.",
    "paragraph3": "The foundation of the breed consisted of three cats: Daddy Warbucks, Fugiana, and Buckwheat (kittens from Josephine from one litter). Josephine and her kittens from a subsequent litter were eliminated by her owner, Mr. Pennels."

  "colors": {
    "title": "Colors of the Ragdoll breed",
    "paragraph1": "Ragdolls come in four basic colors: seal (dark brown markings), blue (blue markings), chocolate (chocolate markings), lilac (lilac markings). Other colors are created by combining the basic colors with red color, with lynx tabby pattern, or with both red color and lynx pattern together. The Ragdoll cat's eyes must always be blue - the bluer the color, the better.",
    "copyright": "I own the copyright to these photos (for a few pieces I have permission from their owners). Please do not copy them without asking first.",
    "paragraph2": "Lilac and chocolate colors are rarer because seal and blue colors are dominant, which means that if lilac or chocolate color is in the pedigree at the grandparent, great-grandparent level and beyond, there is a very small probability that the offspring would be a carrier of chocolate and lilac (I must note that the correct term is: carrier of the dilution gene for lilac coloration). The probability that such offspring would be directly in one of these colors is about as likely as winning the jackpot in the lottery. But the price for these colors is higher only for breeding cats; for pets, the price does not vary by color.",
    "paragraph3": "Also, the colored appearance of the cat usually does not reveal much about the actual color that will be genetically passed on to offspring. The easiest way to verify this is with a genetic color test, which can be easily done for your cat, for example in Germany, in Laboklin or Biofocus laboratories. No blood sampling is necessary; a cheek swab is sufficient, which any breeder can do themselves. I am happy to advise anyone who would be interested in this genetic color test. The test costs about 1500 CZK, which is not such a high amount considering how much Ragdoll cats in chocolate and lilac colors or Ragdoll cats - carriers of chocolate and lilac - are sold for.",
    "hcm_pkd": "The same tests are also used to genetically detect HCM and PKD.",
    "paragraph4": "With this test, we protect (like the Orlitia cattery, from which we have a chocolate kitty Caity with a genetic color test) our good name when selling kittens for breeding, which we present as chocolate, lilac, or carriers of chocolate and lilac. I know what disappointment one experiences when a purchased kitten does not have the color one wanted for their breeding... not to mention the increased price for a kitten due to the attractiveness of the color.",
    "paragraph5": "As an example, I share my own sad experience when I purchased our Penny from the USA as a 100% chocolate lynx ragdoll cat. Her very first litter showed that something was wrong because with our lilac male, kittens were born that were seal. It was then that I first used the possibility of a genetic color test, and unfortunately for us, it showed that Penny is not chocolate and is not even a carrier of chocolate, although her mother is listed in the USA as chocolate (based on the test result, it is clear that Penny's mother is also not chocolate). Therefore, since then, whenever the mother or father is not directly lilac or chocolate, I require this genetic color test so that I cannot be deceived when selling a kitten. It should be noted that in this case, the breeder from the USA did not intend to deceive me, as Penny is indeed in appearance (phenotype) listed in the pedigree as chocolate lynx, because judges at exhibitions assess her color this way."

  "health": {
    "title": "Health and diseases of Ragdolls",
    "paragraph1": "Health is the most precious thing for a human, and it is no different for cats and generally all living creatures. The difference is that a human can say what is bothering them and where something hurts. A cat cannot do this and, on the contrary, tends to hide its health problems from the outside world. Therefore, it is important to observe it, perceive its behavior, and also its overall appearance. Every change has some reason, and it is necessary to figure it out.",
    "paragraph2": "There are many cat diseases, and I want to share my experiences with you rather than just describing individual diseases. But of course, it is necessary to know them, so I provide a link to a page where this topic is thoroughly discussed:",
    "cat_diseases_link": "Cat Diseases",
    "paragraph3": "When describing any of my experiences, it does not mean that someone else could not have had different experiences, and I also do not want to pretend to be smart. The principle always applies that it is better to have one unnecessary visit to the veterinarian than to miss something. In my opinion, the daily health check is important in the first place, which one does essentially automatically by checking and possibly wiping the cat's eyes (I use Opthal Septonex, but boiled water is also good), looking into the ears (I clean them once a week if there is no problem - you can buy drops or gel from the veterinarian). When I take a cat or kitten in my arms and cuddle it, I look at the rear end to see if it is nice and clean. When stroking, I feel what the coat is like to the touch, because a change in coat quality can be the first signal that something is wrong with the cat. When I think the coat has become rough and matted, I increase vigilance and observe the cat more, to see if I notice any other changes and act accordingly.",
    "paragraph4": "I found a really comprehensive overview of cat care, monitoring its health condition, and descriptions of various diseases. I highly recommend reading it!!",
