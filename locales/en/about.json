    "paragraph1": "The Faelis Cat Cattery breeds Ragdoll cats. I have been breeding Ragdoll cats since 2002 and I try to do the breeding as best as possible with everything that comes with it. Nowadays, this includes, among other things, a lot of health tests for breeding cats, participation in exhibitions, etc....",
    "paragraph2": "You can't buy prestige and recognition for a cattery anywhere; you can only achieve it step by step through good and honest breeding work. Saying how good you are yourself is useless; others should judge you this way, and only then can you feel like a good breeder. It's not for nothing that it has been said since ancient times that self-praise stinks :o) In breeding, one is constantly learning something new and constantly encountering things with which one has had no experience yet and must deal with them. Breeding doesn't just bring joy from cute kittens; it's a lot of worries, responsibility, sometimes even sadness, and only somewhere at the end is joy."

    "paragraph": "Faelis cattery is registered with ÄŒSCHK (which belongs to the world organization FIFe) and is thus bound by the Breeding Rules of this organization. In the Czech Republic, I sell female cats for breeding only to similarly registered interested parties, male cats only as pets. I always sell all kittens properly vaccinated and with pedigree certificates at the age of 3 months. I am happy to advise everyone, not just the owners of our kittens. For my kittens, I want only the nicest owners, but I think that's every breeder's dream :o) I give the kittens a starter kit for their first days in their new home."
